R. Marian, D. Campbell, Z. Jin, J. Chahl. (2019) Critical Infrastructure for Industry 4 Laboratories and Learning Factories in Academia. Proceedings of the 2019 IEE IEEM.

"Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR) technologies can plan an increasingly important part in Industry 4 labs. Humans remain a part in many aspects of an Industry 4 ecosystem. AR and VR enable multidimensional visualization of physical and abstract properties in the product lifecycle, as well as education."

Questionaire of 274 design students. No differences distiguished between gender. mixed on whether there was a role for skeumorphic design. Perception that skeumorphism was associated with Apple were flat design was associated with web design.
