R. Marian, D. Campbell, Z. Jin, J. Chahl. (2019) Critical Infrastructure for Industry 4 Laboratories and Learning Factories in Academia. Proceedings of the 2019 IEE IEEM.

"Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR) technologies can plan an increasingly important part in Industry 4 labs. Humans remain a part in many aspects of an Industry 4 ecosystem. AR and VR enable multidimensional visualization of physical and abstract properties in the product lifecycle, as well as education."
