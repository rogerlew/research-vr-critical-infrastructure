R. Marian, D. Campbell, Z. Jin, J. Chahl. (2019) Critical Infrastructure for Industry 4 Laboratories and Learning Factories in Academia. Proceedings of the 2019 IEE IEEM.

"Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR) technologies can plan an increasingly important part in Industry 4 labs. Humans remain a part in many aspects of an Industry 4 ecosystem. AR and VR enable multidimensional visualization of physical and abstract properties in the product lifecycle, as well as education."

Questionaire of 274 design students. No differences distiguished between gender. mixed on whether there was a role for skeumorphic design. Perception that skeumorphism was associated with Apple were flat design was associated with web design.


Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph


Etymology of the term Skeumorph. Derived from the Greek words skeuos (σκεῦος), meaning "container or tool", and morphḗ (μορφή), meaning "shape"

Donald Norman on skeumorphism:  describes skeuomorphism in terms of cultural constraints: interactions with a system that are learned only through culture. Norman also popularized perceived affordances, where the user can tell what an object provides or does based on its appearance, which skeuomorphism can make easy. https://web.archive.org/web/20121120145620/http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances_and.html

Neumorphism -> New Skeumorphism

Originated from Dribble and Instagram


Retrofuturism: incorporates spatial motifs from previous iterations of the future; especially visions of electro-industrialism.[27] This is frequently incorporated in retrowave or synthwave illustrations. Skeumorphic time is closely linked with metamodernism.
